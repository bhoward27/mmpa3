    Assignment Description:

    2D (Discrete Cosine Transform) 
    
    Read N (an integer between 2 and 16) and then an input matrix of size NxN from an input file.
    Each matrix component is an integer between 0 and 255. Print out the 2D DCT transform result (rounding to integers) with
        (1) rows transform first and then columns, and
        (2) columns transform first and then rows.
    
    Note that you can't call any lib to do this; you have to write your own code to implement the matrix operation.
    Discuss whether results (1) and (2) are identical. If not, what's the potential problems.
